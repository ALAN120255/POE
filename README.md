- **Programming Language**: [C#]

## ⚙️ How it works
1. After displaying the program's logo and emits an introduction voice recording,
   the chatbot greets the user and prompts them to enter a username. The username is then used throughout the dialogue. **NB: The dialogue will not go further if user does not enter an input.**
2. The program will continue running, as the user asks the chatbot about any cybersecurity issue like phishing and password. You can even ask of its purpose. I'd advise users to ask of its purpose first before they go any further with the program. In that way, they can have an idea of how to utilize it effeciently.
3. The best part of this program is that the user can ask of its well-being and it will give a response like an actual human. Questions like "How are you" and "How are you doing" are more like prompts to make the chatbot more human. If the user does not input the questions, it will notify the user that it cannot provide an answer for the prompt or input. If the user does, it will respond, "I'm good, thanks and you?"
4. If the user says no, or "I'm not okay". It will display a message showing concern about the user's cybersecurity. If the user says yes, then it will say, "Great, how may I assist you?"

## 🚩 Disadvantages/Red flags
The program only gives advices on phishing and password strengthening for now😬, but improvements will be made over time. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
