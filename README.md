#Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot

Hey! Welcome to my project's ReadME.

##A chatbot that helps you tackle any cyber threats

##Brief description

This project is mainly an AI/chatbot that supports the user's cyber well-being, 
making their lives more easier.

##Features

###Function

Firstly, the program begins by welcoming the user, making it user-friendly, and engaging.
Just as an actual person asks your name to demonstrate their interest in getting to know you, so does the chatbot.
It asks your name, and an interesting dialogue about battling cyber issues commences. There is a hurdle
in the functioning of this program's dialogue. If you don't enter any input (if you just press the ENTER button),
it will keep on displaying an error message in red, instructing the user to enter a valid input up until the
user enter an input. The program then adopts the user's name/username and uses it throughout their dialogue with the chatbot.

The program then goes further to prompt the user to enquire about anything cybersecurity related. If the user enters anything
that's not cybersecurity related, it displays a message that notify the user that it can only provide answers or responses 
concerning cybersecurity issues like phishing, passwords or asking about the purpose of the program. The chatbot is able to 
interact with the user quite well. When asked of its well-being using prompts like, "How are you?", or "How are you doing?",
it gives feedback like an actual human would. If a user's input is out of context or invalid, the user is notified.
